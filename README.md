# donut
A program that runs ASCII donut and other geometric shapes using ASCII and linear algebra.
Code is based on the post made by [a1k0n](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) on how to make an ASCII donut. Main idea is to replicate it in both C and Javascript and apply quaternion rotation to it (plus adding some extra shapes).

## TODO list
[ ] Comprehend donut code from a1k0n
[ ] Replicate code from a1k0n in both C and Javascript
[ ] Apply quaternion rotation to the code
[ ] Apply code to other geometric shapes:
  - [ ] Square
  - [ ] Pyramid
